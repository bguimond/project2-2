;; Project 2: Computing the total area covered by a set of rectangles (Quad-trees and immutable data-structures)

(provide total-rect-area)

; total-rect-area: returns the total integer area covered by any (one or more) rectangles in the given list 
; Don't double-count. Should be identical to the same solution from e3.rkt, except this version must be in O(n log n)
; Hint: try implementing an immutable quad-tree to represent 2D space; FYI, a solution takes only ~30-40 lines of code.
